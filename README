Web interface for the Central Ancillary Program

This interface is designed to be a web interface to the CAP program for generating climate ancillary files. Intended users are climate scientists requiring custom ancillary files for Unified Model simulations.

To generate a set of ancillary files a user enters the configuration into the web form, modifying a set of sensible defaults, then submits the form. The files are generated remotely then made available on a ftp site for download.

An objective is to have the web interface configurable by a set of metadata files, preferably compatabile with the ROSE tool, so that the configuration can easily be altered to add new features rather than having these hardcoded into the interface.

The interface will generate a script to be submitted to a remote server to generate the ancillary files, which will be copied to a ftp server. Generated scripts should be as secure as possible.

Advanced features not useful for the majority of users should be hidden by default.

To run unit tests ensure PHPUnit is installed and run
$ make check
